License Checker Tool
====================
An online tool such that a user who has just created a dataset, using certain ontologies, is allowed to provide the dataset to the system which retrieves the licenses associated to the used vocabularies (through LOV) and, using the formal tool we have returns the licensing terms you are allowed to associate to the dataset w.r.t. the licenses on the vocabularies used to build the dataset itself.
